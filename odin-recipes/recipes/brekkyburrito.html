    <h2>Breakfast Burrito Recipe</h2>
    <p>My own personal favorite breakfast burrito recipe (or one of them) off the top of my head.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking diced potatoes with butter</li>
        <li>Add in chopped sausage or bacon after potatoes are slightly golden/brown</li>
        <li>Let potatoes and sausage cook for a while</li>
        <li>(Optional) Chop up some sweet peppers and add for more flavor</li>
        <li>Add spinach, let it cook down, and add more spinach</li>
        <li>Use however many eggs you want (3-4 for me) and cook in with the rest</li>
        <li>After it's finished cooking, set to the side and crisp/prepare your tortilla in a skillet</li>
        <li>Add eggs, potatotes, sausages, and spinach to the tortilla</li>
        <li>Take some avocado or guac and slap that on top</li>
        <li>Wrap your burrito, and have it with some Cholula and/or your favorite salsa</li>
    </ol>
